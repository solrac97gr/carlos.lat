        title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
        subtitle: "Everything you need to know before getting started",
        question1: "We already use GitHub Copilot. Why do we need this?",
        answer1: "Copilot is excellent at code completion, but it doesn't enforce your architecture patterns or provide standardization across your team. This complements Copilot by ensuring every developer uses it (and Claude, and any AI tool) consistently and effectively within your specific workflows.",
        question2: "How much time will this take from my team?",
        answer2: "Just 3 hours during Week 1 for interviews, and 2-4 hours for training in Week 5. Everything else happens without interrupting your development schedule.",
        question3: "What if it doesn't work for our specific tech stack?",
        answer3: "I customize everything to your stack—whether you're using React, Go, Python, or anything else. The plugins are built specifically for your codebase, not generic templates. Plus, if you don't see measurable results in 30 days, I'll work with you for an additional 30 days at no extra cost.",
        question4: "Can't our developers just figure this out themselves?",
        answer4: "They could, over 6-12 months of trial and error, each doing it differently. This gives you a proven system in 5 weeks with guaranteed ROI. Your developers can focus on building product, not figuring out how to optimize AI prompts.",
        question5: "What happens after the initial 5 weeks?",
        answer5: "You get ongoing support (2 weeks to 3 months depending on package), plus your team knows how to maintain and extend the system. Most clients add new plugins quarterly as their needs evolve, but the core system runs autonomously.",
        question6: "Do you work with remote teams across time zones?",
        answer6: "Absolutely. All training sessions are recorded, and I'm flexible with scheduling. Most of my work is asynchronous, and I adapt to your team's availability."

        title: "Preguntas Frecuentes",
        subtitle: "Todo lo que necesitas saber antes de comenzar",
        question1: "Ya usamos GitHub Copilot. ¿Por qué necesitamos esto?",
        answer1: "Copilot es excelente para completar código, pero no aplica tus patrones de arquitectura ni proporciona estandarización en tu equipo. Esto complementa a Copilot asegurando que cada desarrollador lo use (y Claude, y cualquier herramienta de IA) de manera consistente y efectiva dentro de tus flujos específicos.",
        question2: "¿Cuánto tiempo tomará de mi equipo?",
        answer2: "Solo 3 horas durante la Semana 1 para entrevistas, y 2-4 horas para capacitación en la Semana 5. Todo lo demás sucede sin interrumpir tu calendario de desarrollo.",
        question3: "¿Qué pasa si no funciona para nuestro stack técnico específico?",
        answer3: "Personalizo todo para tu stack—ya sea que uses React, Go, Python o cualquier otra cosa. Los plugins se construyen específicamente para tu código, no son plantillas genéricas. Además, si no ves resultados medibles en 30 días, trabajaré contigo por 30 días adicionales sin costo extra.",
        question4: "¿No pueden nuestros desarrolladores simplemente descubrir esto por sí mismos?",
        answer4: "Podrían, durante 6-12 meses de prueba y error, cada uno haciéndolo diferente. Esto te da un sistema probado en 5 semanas con ROI garantizado. Tus desarrolladores pueden enfocarse en construir producto, no en descubrir cómo optimizar prompts de IA.",
        question5: "¿Qué pasa después de las 5 semanas iniciales?",
        answer5: "Obtienes soporte continuo (2 semanas a 3 meses según el paquete), además tu equipo sabe cómo mantener y extender el sistema. La mayoría de los clientes agregan nuevos plugins trimestralmente conforme evolucionan sus necesidades, pero el sistema central funciona de forma autónoma.",
        question6: "¿Trabajas con equipos remotos en diferentes zonas horarias?",
        answer6: "Absolutamente. Todas las sesiones de capacitación se graban, y soy flexible con la programación. La mayor parte de mi trabajo es asíncrono, y me adapto a la disponibilidad de tu equipo."
