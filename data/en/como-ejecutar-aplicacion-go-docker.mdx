In the last decade, Docker has become popular as a development mechanism thanks to its many advantages such as:

- Small development environments with the minimum needed to run.
- Being able to share them easily without worrying about dependencies.
- Various cloud services use them as standard to run your application easily.
- Easy and intuitive syntax to declare our container configuration.

Therefore, today we'll create a Go application that will be executed from a Docker container. This will be the first part of a tutorial where we'll deploy an API made in Go to Google Cloud ☁️.

## Creating Our Project

For this we'll open a terminal and navigate to the folder where we want to create our project. In my case, my folder is Development.

Once inside the folder we'll create a new project:

<CodeSnippet language="bash" code={`mkdir fiber-docker`} />

Inside this folder we'll initialize Go modules to manage our Go project dependencies.

<CodeSnippet language="bash" code={`go mod init github.com/solrac97g/fiber-docker`} />

Now we'll create a Go file that will be our main:

<CodeSnippet language="bash" code={`touch main.go`} />

And we'll create our docker file

<CodeSnippet language="bash" code={`touch dockerfile`} />

This will be the minimum we'll require to run our Go project for now.

## Modifying the Main

Inside main we'll execute the following code which will set up an HTTP server using Fiber, a Go framework, and expose it on port 8080.

<CodeSnippet language="go" code={`
package main

import (
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
	})

	app.Get("/ping", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		return c.SendString("pong")
	})

	log.Fatal(app.Listen(":8080"))
}
`} />


Don't forget to install our dependency. From the terminal we'll add the dependency to our project:

<CodeSnippet language="bash" code={`go get github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2`} />

Now we have our code ready to work. What this script basically does is create two endpoints: the main one "/" which responds with "hello world" and "/ping" which responds with "pong".

## Configuring Our Docker Container

To configure our Docker container we'll edit our dockerfile

<CodeSnippet language="dockerfile" code={`
FROM golang:1.18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod .
COPY go.sum .
RUN go mod download
COPY . .
RUN go build -o ./out/dist .
CMD ./out/dist
`} />

What this does is create a container that runs Go 1.18, then copies the dependency files to the container and downloads the dependencies to finally build the project and execute it.

## Running Our Project

Finally we can run our container using the following command first to build our container.

<CodeSnippet language="bash" code={`docker build -t app .`} />

And now the following command to start our container.

<CodeSnippet language="bash" code={`docker run -p 8888:8080 app`} />

Our project will be ready to receive requests from the URL: http://localhost:8888
