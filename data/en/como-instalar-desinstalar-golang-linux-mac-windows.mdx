In this article we'll see how to correctly install and uninstall Go on Linux, Mac and Windows. For this we'll follow the [official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Installing Go on Linux 🐧 (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, etc.)

To install Go on Linux we'll use our operating system's package manager. In this case we'll use Ubuntu 20.04.

<CodeSnippet language={"bash"} route={"~"} code={`sudo apt install golang`} />


Once installed we can check the version of Go we have installed.

<CodeSnippet language={"bash"} route={"~"} code={`go version`} output={"go version go1.19.1 darwin/arm64"}/>


## Installing Go on Mac 🍎

To install Go on Mac we'll use our operating system's package manager. In this case we'll use Homebrew.

<CodeSnippet language={"bash"} route={"~"} code={`brew install go`} />


Once installed we can check the version of Go we have installed.

<CodeSnippet language={"bash"} route={"~"} code={`go version`} output={"go version go1.19.1 darwin/arm64"}/>


## Installing Go on Windows 🖥️

To install Go on Windows we'll use the official Go installer.

1. Download the Go installer from the [official page](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Run the installer and follow the steps it indicates.
3. Once installed we can check the version of Go we have installed.

<CodeSnippet language={"bash"} route={"~"} code={`go version`} output={"go version go1.19.1 darwin/arm64"}/>

## Uninstalling Go on Linux 🐧 (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, etc.)

To uninstall Go on Linux we'll use our operating system's package manager. In this case we'll use Ubuntu 20.04.

<CodeSnippet language={"bash"} route={"~"} code={`sudo apt remove golang`} />

## Uninstalling Go on Mac 🍎

To uninstall Go on Mac we'll use our operating system's package manager. In this case we'll use Homebrew.

<CodeSnippet language={"bash"} route={"~"} code={`brew uninstall go`} />

## Uninstalling Go on Windows 🖥️

To uninstall Go on Windows we'll use the official Go uninstaller.

1. Run the uninstaller and follow the steps it indicates.
2. Once uninstalled we can verify that we no longer have Go installed.

<CodeSnippet language={"bash"} route={"~"} code={`go version`} output={"go version go1.19.1 darwin/arm64"}/>
