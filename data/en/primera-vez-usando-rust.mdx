# My First Time Using Rust, Not Very Happy... 🦀

```rust
      println!("Hello World 🌎");
```

Yes, that was exactly clickbait. I'm very happy with my first experience developing a small script using Rust. I'm a Backend developer who works with Go most of the time, also a bit of TypeScript and Elixir.

### The Project

To try this programming language, days ago I was watching some videos on YouTube to get inspired and have some idea of what projects I could do. After a few days, I found a project.

This project was about creating a script that would organize your downloads folder based on file types (We could also do it by date), so this script must review the content of a certain folder and according to the extension categorize it in another subfolder. It sounds quite easy if you've already done it with Python or Go.

### The Language: Rust

I won't lie to you - I saw the opportunity to use a new and cutting-edge programming language and I took it. I read about the performance of this language and the concept of borrowing and I found it interesting.

### Shut Up and Give Me the Code

If you're curious about how this script works, you can review it below and try it. In my case, for its use, I programmed the execution the moment I open a terminal (Very frequently). I'll be very happy if more experienced Rust programmers can give me suggestions. If you have any suggestions, you can write to me on Twitter or make a Pull Request on Github.

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::path::Path;

use std::env;
extern crate dotenv;



fn main() {
    
        dotenv::from_path("./.env").expect("error loading env");
        
        let path_to_images = env::var("PATH_IMAGES").expect("env error");
        let path_to_videos = env::var("PATH_VIDEOS").expect("env error");
        let path_to_audios = env::var("PATH_AUDIOS").expect("env error");
        let path_to_documents =env::var("PATH_DOCUMENTS").expect("env error");
        let path_to_installers = env::var("PATH_INSTALLERS").expect("env error");

        for entry in fs::read_dir(env::var("FOLDER_TO_ORGANIZE").expect("env error")).unwrap() {
            let entry = entry.unwrap();
            let path = entry.path();
           
            if path.is_file() {
                if Path::new(&path).extension() != None && Path::new(&path).file_name() != None {
                    
                    let path_string = Path::new(&path).to_str().unwrap();
                    let file_name = Path::new(&path).file_name().unwrap().to_str().unwrap();
                    let file_type= Path::new(&path).extension().unwrap();

                    //IMAGES

                        fs::copy(path_string,destination_file).expect("copy error");
                        
                    }

                        fs::copy(path_string,destination_file).expect("copy error");
                    }
                    //DOCUMENTS
                    if file_type == "pdf" || file_type == "doc" || file_type == "docx" || file_type == "ppt" || file_type == "xls"{
                        let destination_file = format!("{}/{}",path_to_documents,file_name);
                        fs::copy(path_string,destination_file).expect("copy error");
                    }
                    //VIDEOS
                    if file_type == "mp4" || file_type == "avi" {
                        let destination_file = format!("{}/{}",path_to_videos,file_name);
                        fs::copy(path_string,destination_file).expect("copy error");
                    }
                    //AUDIOS
                    if file_type == "mp3" {
                        let destination_file = format!("{}/{}",path_to_audios,file_name);
                        fs::copy(path_string,destination_file).expect("copy error");
                    }

                    fs::remove_file(path_string).expect("remove error");
                }
            }
        }
    
}
