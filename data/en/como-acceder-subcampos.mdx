Starting with the common problem of creating more generic functions, I once dealt with a similar issue: accessing sub-fields within a **map[string]interface{}** interface. The solution is much simpler than you think, starting by identifying which field we need within our structure. After that, everything is simpler - you'll need a simple conversion of the field that has a sub-field to a **map[string]interface{}** interface and then access the field you need. Finally, you need to convert the value to your desired type. For this example, I don't use validation for field existence, but it's highly recommended.

<CodeSnippet language={"go"} route={"main.go"} code={`
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    subMap := map[string]interface{}{
        "sqlid": 1,
    }

    Map := map[string]interface{}{
        "metadata": subMap,
    }

    sqlid := Map["metadata"].(map[string]interface{})["sqlid"].(int)

    fmt.Println(sqlid)
}
`} />

I hope this brief article helps you easily solve this problem in the future. Happy coding and save this article so you never lose the solution.
