This year I discovered many interesting tools as a Backend developer using Go and some other personal projects with Typescript, Flutter and Rust. I'm sharing the list of tools I use to program and everything that this beautiful profession entails.

## 1. The Hardware (Macbook Air 2020 M1 🍎)

For 2022 I traveled a lot so I went very light with my Macbook Air 2020 with the M1 chip, a small stand for the laptop and that's it. I used a tablet as a second screen sometimes but I stopped because I had to carry it and I kept forgetting it.

## 2. The Terminal (Warp 🖥️)

I finished 2022 changing my terminal - after using iTerm for 3 years I decided to switch to Warp, a more modern terminal with autocomplete. I'll leave you a photo and download link. Before, to achieve what Warp does, I had Fig and iTerm together.

- Old terminal: <BlogLink url="https://iterm2.com/" content="iTerm"/>
- Old autocomplete: <BlogLink url="https://fig.io/" content="Fig"/>

## 3. The Editor (VSCode 📝)

This year I fell in love with VSCode and I use it to program in Typescript, Flutter, Rust, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc. It's a very powerful editor with many extensions that make it very versatile. However, for programming in Go and Flutter I decided to use IDEs. I'll leave you a photo of my editor and the download link.

## 4. The IDE (GoLand 🐹)

For programming in Go I decided to use GoLand, a JetBrains IDE that I really like for its debugger and its multiple tools like autocompletion of database entities in queries since I don't use ORM. It's a very powerful IDE with many extensions that make it very versatile.

For Flutter I use Android Studio which is a Google IDE and is very powerful for programming in Flutter.

- Flutter IDE: <BlogLink url="https://developer.android.com/studio" content="Android Studio"/>
- Theme: <BlogLink url="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10936-night-owl-theme" content="Night Owl"/>

  style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
/>

## 5. The Browser (Safari 🧭)

I work with Safari as my main browser and use Chrome to develop in Javascript and Typescript. Safari is a very stable and fast browser and it's what I use for almost everything except for developing in the aforementioned languages.

## 6. API Consumption (Postman 📡)

Almost a standard in the backend development world, a very powerful tool with collections and environments that even allows you to perform tests for your API. It's a tool I use a lot to test my APIs and to document them.

## 7. Database Manager (POPSql 📊)

This year I discovered POPSql, a modern database manager that even allows you to generate reports and work in a collaborative environment with different databases.

## 8. Package Manager (Homebrew 🍺)

Homebrew is a package manager for Mac that allows me to install packages very easily and quickly. I use it for something very superficial - I like how it makes colored outputs with emojis 😂.

## 9. Version Manager (Git 📦)

Git is a version manager that I use for all my projects and it's what I use to work in teams. I use it mainly with Github - I really love the social factor that Github has and the community that has formed around it.

> Note 📝: I use a command to see the graph of the branches in my repository, which is what you see in the image.

  style={{ borderRadius: "8px" }}
/>

## 10. Containers (Docker and Raycast 🐳)

Docker is a tool that allows me to create containers for my applications and it's a tool I use a lot to create development and production environments. As for Raycast, I use an extension to control my Docker containers from my search bar.

## 11. To Stay Organized (Notion 📝)

Notion is a super powerful tool that allows you to adapt it to your needs in a way that makes it easier for you to do your work.

## 12. Special Mention for Tools I Use When I Don't Have Internet (Dash 📚 and DevUtils 🛠)

Dash allows you to download documentation from different languages and frameworks so you can consult it without internet. DevUtils is a tool that allows you to perform different tasks quickly and easily such as date conversions, colors or JWT payload extraction.
