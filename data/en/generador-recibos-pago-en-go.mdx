If you have a small business or work as a freelancer, you know that billing can be a tedious and time-consuming task. Fortunately, there are available tools that automate this process and make your life easier. The Payment Receipt Generator repository is based on Go and allows you to generate invoices quickly and efficiently. Here's how it works:

1. **Installation:** To use Payment Receipt Generator, you first need to download and install the Go programming language on your computer. Once you have Go installed, you can clone the GitHub repository and run it on your local machine. To run it you can execute the command

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   or you can compile and run it as the run file and generate the process in the background

   ```bash
    ./run.sh
   ```

2. **Configuration:** Payment Receipt Generator is highly customizable thanks to its configuration file. By editing this file, you can specify details such as your business name and address, as well as payment terms, currency, and tax rate. Once you've configured the generator to your liking, you can simply run it and let it do the work for you.
   The configuration file is as follows:

   ```json
   {
     "payment_details": {
       "company": {
         "name": "Google Inc.",
         "address": "Amazing Garage in Sillicon Valley, United States",
         "representative": "Mr Google",
         "email": "mr.google@google.com",
         "website": "https://google.com"
       },

       "issuer": {
         "name": "Jhon Doe",
         "address": "Amazing House in New York, United States",
         "email": "jhon.doe@gmail.com",
         "phone": "+51999999999",
         "website": "https://google.com"
       },

       "works": [
         {
           "description": "Software Development Services",
           "quantity": 3,
           "unit_price": 8000,
           "currency": "USD"
         },
         {
           "description": "UX/UI Services",
           "quantity": 2,
           "unit_price": 900,
           "currency": "USD"
         },
         {
           "description": "Consulting Services",
           "quantity": 5,
           "unit_price": 500,
           "currency": "USD"
         },
         {
           "description": "Hosting Services",
           "quantity": 2,
           "unit_price": 100,
           "currency": "USD"
         },
         {
           "description": "Domain Registration",
           "quantity": 9,
           "unit_price": 10,
           "currency": "USD"
         }
       ]
     },
     "output": {
       "folder_path": "./out/",
       "file_type": "pdf"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Background execution:** One of the most powerful features of Payment Receipt Generator is its ability to run in the background. By setting up a cron job, you can schedule the generator to run automatically at specific intervals, such as the 15th and 30th of each month. This means you can generate invoices without having to think about it, freeing up your time for other tasks. You can find the PID in the out file so when you want to stop the process you can do so using

   ```bash
   kill -9 PID
   ```

4. **Output formats:** Payment Receipt Generator can currently generate invoices using only PDF but you can contribute to add more formats.

5. **Invoice example:** Here's an example of an invoice generated by Payment Receipt Generator:
